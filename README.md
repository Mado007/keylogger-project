#### **Features**  
- Captures keystrokes in real-time  
- Stores logs with timestamps  
- Sends logs via email automatically  
- Uses environment variables for secure credential handling  
- Stops logging when the **Esc** key is pressed  

#### **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**  
- **pynput** (for keyboard event listening)  
- **smtplib** (for email automation)
